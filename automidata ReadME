🧮 Automatidata NYC Taxi Fare Prediction
📘 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone course.
The goal was to build and evaluate a multiple linear regression model to predict New York City taxi fares based on trip characteristics such as distance, duration, and passenger count.

The project was conducted by Automatidata, a data consulting firm, in partnership with the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).
The dataset used represents one year of NYC taxi trip data.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze and clean NYC taxi trip data.

Identify and engineer relevant features influencing fare amounts.

Build and evaluate a multiple linear regression model.

Interpret model coefficients to provide actionable insights.

Make data-driven recommendations to improve fare prediction accuracy.

🧰 Tools and Technologies

Python

pandas, numpy — data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib, seaborn — data visualization

statsmodels, scikit-learn — regression modeling and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code — coding environment

📊 Workflow
1. Data Exploration

Loaded and examined the dataset to understand its structure.

Identified missing values, outliers, and invalid entries (e.g., negative fares or zero trip distances).

2. Data Cleaning

Removed invalid and duplicate records.

Handled missing data through imputation and filtering.

Created relevant subsets for modeling.

3. Feature Engineering

Created new variables such as trip duration and fare per mile.

Encoded categorical variables like payment_type and passenger_count.

Checked correlations between independent variables and fare amount.

4. Modeling

Built a Multiple Linear Regression model using statsmodels.OLS().

Examined key statistics:

Coefficients

P-values

R² and Adjusted R²

Standard errors

5. Model Evaluation

Compared predicted vs. actual fares.

Checked assumptions: linearity, multicollinearity, and normality of residuals.

Calculated performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².

📈 Results

The final model achieved an R² score of ~0.84, indicating strong predictive performance.

Key predictors of fare amount included:

Trip distance (strongest positive correlation)

Trip duration

Time of day (peak vs. off-peak)

💡 Insights & Recommendations

Distance is the most significant determinant of fare cost.

Including additional features such as weather or traffic conditions may further improve prediction accuracy.

Deploying the model via an API can enable real-time fare predictions for drivers and customers.
