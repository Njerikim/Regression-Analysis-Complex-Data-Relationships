Multiple Linear Regression using the Penguins Dataset

This project demonstrates how to build, evaluate, and interpret a Multiple Linear Regression model using the Palmer Penguins dataset. The model explores how variables such as bill length, gender, and species affect the body mass of penguins.

📦 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the penguins dataset.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Build a multiple linear regression model using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

Interpret the regression coefficients for meaningful insights.

🧰 Technologies and Libraries Used

Python 3.x

Pandas – Data manipulation

Seaborn – Dataset loading and visualization

Scikit-learn – Train-test splitting

Statsmodels – Regression modeling and statistical summary

📊 Dataset

The Palmer Penguins dataset is a built-in dataset from Seaborn.
It contains physical measurements for three penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

Variables used:

body_mass_g – Dependent variable (target)

bill_length_mm – Independent variable

sex (renamed to gender) – Independent variable

species – Independent variable

🧹 Data Cleaning

Subset the dataset to include only relevant columns.

Rename columns for clarity.

Drop rows with missing values.

Reset the index for a clean dataset.

penguins = penguins[["body_mass_g", "bill_length_mm", "sex", "species"]]
penguins.columns = ["body_mass_g", "bill_length_mm", "gender", "species"]
penguins.dropna(inplace=True)
penguins.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

🧪 Model Construction

The model uses the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method with the following formula:

ols_formula = "body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm + C(gender) + C(species)"


This allows for:

C(gender) – Encoded as categorical (reference: Female)

C(species) – Encoded as categorical (reference: Adelie)

🔍 Model Evaluation

After fitting the model, we summarize and interpret the coefficients:

1. Gender (C(gender)[T.Male])

Males weigh approximately 528.95 grams more than females (reference group).

2. Species

Chinstrap penguins weigh about 285.39 grams less than Adelie penguins.

Gentoo penguins weigh about 1,081.62 grams more than Adelie penguins.

3. Bill length (mm)

For each additional millimeter in bill length, the body mass increases by 35.55 grams, holding other factors constant.

📈 Insights

Gender and species have strong effects on penguin body mass.

Bill length is a continuous predictor that also contributes positively to body mass.

The model helps in understanding biological relationships and physical variations across species.
